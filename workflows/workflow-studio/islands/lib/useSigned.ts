 * origin is opaque: it carries no cookie and a `/api/uploads/...` URL 401s. A clip, a
 * source's WAV, a contact sheet or a blog frame therefore has to be exchanged for a
 * presigned URL over the bridge (`bffless/workflow-hello`'s `line-viewer` is the
 * reference). Shared by every island under `islands/` — `cut-editor` signs its media
 * up front with `useSigned`, each path landing as its own answer returns; `blog-editor`
 * signs the post's frames and its sibling candidates on demand with `signPath`.
