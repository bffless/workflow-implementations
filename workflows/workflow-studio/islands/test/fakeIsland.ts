/**
 * The HOST half of the island bridge, for an island's own unit tests.
 *
 * Adapted from the harness's `apps/workflow/src/islands/fakeIsland.ts` — **inverted**.
 * That file is the *View* side (a real `@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps` `App` driven
 * over `InMemoryTransport`) so that tests of `IslandHost` exercise a real island; here
 * the subject under test *is* the View, so what a test has to supply is the other end:
 * something that answers `callServerTool` and carries a host context.
 *
 * What changed, and why not the real `App` over a linked transport:
 *
 * - **Direction.** `createFakeIsland()` → `createFakeHost()`. The harness's version
 *   hands the test an `App`; this one hands the test the object an island's `Editor`
 *   takes as its `bridge` prop.
 * - **No transport.** The real `App` needs a *host* on the other end that answers
 *   `ui/initialize`, `tools/call` and the host-context notification — i.e. the
 *   harness's own `createIslandHost`, which lives in another app and is not this
 *   app's to import. The wire itself is already proven there (`IslandHost.test.ts`
 *   asserts every one of those round trips against the real `App`); what is left to
 *   prove here is the *island's* behaviour given a host, so the fake stops at the
 *   two methods `IslandBridge` declares.
 * - **The fidelity anchor is the type.** `main.tsx` passes the real `App` as the
 *   `bridge`, so `IslandBridge` must stay structurally satisfied by it — a change to
 *   the SDK's `callServerTool`/`getHostContext` signature fails `tsc`, not silently a
 *   test.
 * - **Recording + scripting.** `calls` keeps every `{ name, arguments }` in order (the
 *   harness's `toolInputs`/`teardowns` counters play the same role), and `answer()`
 *   scripts one tool name — including a tool *error*, which the host reports as an
 *   `isError` result rather than a rejection (04), and a rejection, which is what a
 *   transport failure reads as.
