/**
 * Auto-trim dead space (story 13e): a deterministic, client-side tool that
 * turns measured dead space into cuts — no AI. Given the silence-threshold /
 * minimum-pause / keep-padding knobs, it derives which spans of true silence
 * die and hands them to the editor as ONE batch of manual cuts (written through
 * `scene.refined`, `source: 'manual'`, like any drag — so revert still works).
 *
 * The span→cuts derivation here is pure arithmetic over dead-space spans. The
 * *threshold* knob operates a level up: at the measured default it reuses the
 * spans 13c stored in the slice; any other value re-derives spans from the
 * WAV's per-slice RMS (`deadSpaceSpans`) — the stored spans are binary, the
 * energy behind them is gone, so a threshold can't be re-applied to them.
