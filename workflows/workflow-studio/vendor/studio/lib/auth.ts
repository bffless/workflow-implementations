/**
 * Session refresh for Studio.
 *
 * Studio is served at `studio.<primary-domain>` — a *subdomain of the primary
 * domain* — so the session lives in the SuperTokens `sAccessToken` /
 * `sRefreshToken` cookies shared on `.<primary-domain>`. There is no
 * `bffless_access` / `bffless_refresh` cookie here (those only exist on
 * cross-origin custom domains), which is why the built-in `/_bffless/auth/refresh`
 * relay can't help: it only knows how to refresh the latter.
 *
 * So we do what the admin portal's SuperTokens SDK does — POST the SuperTokens
 * refresh endpoint directly. That reaches the CE backend via the `/api/auth/*`
 * proxy rule authored in `.bffless/proxy-rules/studio/` (forwardCookies: ON), which
 * forwards the path-scoped `sRefreshToken` and relays the rotated `Set-Cookie`
 * headers back, minting a fresh `sAccessToken`.
 *
 * Why this exists: a long auto-build outlives the access token's TTL. Every
 * `/api/*` call is gated by the proxy middleware, which answers an expired token
 * with `401 {"message":"try refresh token"}`. Studio used to surface that string
 * verbatim as an error and abandon the run; now it refreshes and retries in place.

/**
 * SuperTokens *rotates* the refresh token on every refresh, so two concurrent
 * refreshes race on the same `sRefreshToken`: the first rotation invalidates the
 * token the others are holding, failing them and risking a token-theft trip. A
 * long build fans out into many concurrent `/api/*` calls (job polls, per-scene
 * refiners, presigned uploads) that all 401 at once, so this is the common case,
 * not the edge case.
 *
 * The mutex makes it single-flight: the first 401 acquires it and refreshes;
 * everyone else waits that one refresh out and reuses its outcome. Every 401 path
 * — the RTK base query and `fetchWithReauth` — goes through `attemptRefresh`, so
 * the whole app issues exactly one refresh per expiry.
