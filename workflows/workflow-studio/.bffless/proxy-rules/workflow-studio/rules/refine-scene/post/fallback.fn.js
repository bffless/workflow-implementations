  // Replicate/Gemini call died — most often because the provider's audio input
  // is unavailable. Two shapes seen in the wild, both intermittent and both
  // upstream of us: the Gemini Files API upload fails in ~1s (independent of
  // file size, model or scene length), or the upload succeeds ("Audio ready")
  // and the generateContent call referencing that file comes back 403
  // PERMISSION_DENIED a few seconds later. Everything ELSE in the request still
  // works, so rather than surfacing an error we re-run deaf: same prompt,
  // same contact sheets, same word timings, minus the one input the provider
  // can't take right now. (Studio's note also listed the measured dead space
  // here; this port never has any - Decision 17 / R136.) `parse` passes
  // `heardAudio` back to the client so a deaf refine is visible rather than
  // silent.
