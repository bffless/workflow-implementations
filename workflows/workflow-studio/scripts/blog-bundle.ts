/**
 * `blog-bundle` — `blog` → step `bundle`.
 *
 *   with:    { markdown, title, frames, byTime }
 *   outputs: { zip, post, srcs }
 *
 * The portable deliverable (Studio issue #71): one archive holding `post.md` plus an
 * `images/` folder, so the post renders wherever the creator unzips it. Three of
 * Studio's helpers do the work — `rewriteFrameTokens` turns each surviving
 * `frame:<t>` token into a real image, `planBlogBundle` re-homes those images onto
 * relative `images/frame-NN.jpg` paths (deduping a reused frame) and names the
 * archive `<blogSlug(title)>.zip`, and `fflate` packs it. A `Blob`/`File` returned
 * from a `script` step is uploaded by the harness and becomes the `file` output.
 *
 * `byTime` maps a frame's GLOBAL token second → its uploads-relative path. That is a
 * `frame:<t>` token's own clock (R135), because `frame-times` sends the global second
 * along as `captures[].key` and the `video/frames` rule keys the map by it (R140) —
 * so a token is looked up directly here, with no timeline to re-derive. `frames` are
 * the registered File refs for the tokens' own paths (a picker candidate the reviewer
 * chose is fetched through a ref built from its path instead — `serveRef`); a ref is what `ctx.files.fetch`
 * needs to pull the bytes back same-origin.
 *
 * The "url" baked into the markdown before `planBlogBundle` sees it is deliberately
 * the frame's PATH, not its serve URL: `planBlogBundle` only uses it as a dedup key
 * and immediately replaces it with the relative path, and a path keys back into
 * `frames` without a URL-shape assumption.
 *
 * `planBlogBundle` bundles EVERY `![alt](url)` in the post, not just the ones this
 * step captured — an image the creator pasted into the `edit` form is re-homed to
 * `images/frame-NN.jpg` too. A Worker cannot fetch an arbitrary URL, so any planned
 * image whose bytes are not in hand has its ORIGINAL url put back (Studio's
 * `replaceBlogImageUrl`) and is warned about: the post still renders that image
 * wherever it is read, and the zip never advertises a file it does not hold.
 *
 * `srcs` maps each bundled image's zip-relative path (`images/frame-NN.jpg`, the src
 * `post` now uses) back to the frame's uploads-relative path: the harness `images`
 * map (workflow spec 02, apps#446) the `post` output declares, so a finished run's
 * Output tab draws the re-homed images from the harness's own serve route. An image
 * that was left out of the archive is not in it — its src still points where it lives.
