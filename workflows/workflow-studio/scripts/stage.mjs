// Modeled on `bffless/workflow-hello`'s `scripts/build.mjs` (ref 195b5a2) — same shape, same

//   * hello COPIES its scripts verbatim (they are hand-written `.js`); Studio's six are
//     TypeScript that import Studio's pure libs, so each is a Vite library build
//     (`vite.scripts.config.ts`, one entry per build) and the entries are an explicit list
//     rather than a directory scan: `scripts/` also holds this file, `scripts/lib/` support
//     code and `scripts/*.test.ts` suites, none of which is a step module.
//   * the type-check is this app's three `tsc -p` projects (islands / scripts / node
//     tooling), not hello's single `tsconfig.json`.
//
// Deliberately plain JS, outside every TS project (as hello's build.mjs is): it is the thing
// that RUNS `tsc`, so it cannot be an input to it. Its behaviour is covered by
// `src/stage.test.ts`, which runs it for real.
