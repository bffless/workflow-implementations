/**
 * `frame-times` — `blog` → step `times`.
 *
 *   with:    { markdown, sources, durations, siblings? }
 *   outputs: { captures: [{ source, time, name, key }] }
 *
 * The blog writer places its images as `![caption](frame:<t>)` tokens, where `<t>`
 * is a second on the GLOBAL (concatenated) clock — the same clock the director read
 * and the blog rule re-stamps its transcript onto (R135). `video/frames` seeks ONE
 * recording at a time, so every token has to come back as a capture LOCAL to the
 * source that owns it. That routing is Studio's `planBlogCaptures` (dedup by
 * timestamp, `globalToLocal` over the cumulative durations, `frame-NN.jpg` in
 * first-appearance order); this step only builds its `SourceLike[]` and renames the
 * result to the pipeline's field names.
 *
 * `captures[].source` is each ref's uploads-relative PATH, never its serve URL —
 * the `video/frames` rule's R129 guard refuses anything outside `workflows/`.
 *
 * Each capture carries BOTH clocks (R140): `time` is the LOCAL second CE seeks to in
 * `source`, and `key` is the GLOBAL second the token was written with. The rule keys
 * its `byTime` map by `key`, so `blog-bundle` — which only ever sees the post's global
 * token times — can look a frame up without re-deriving the timeline. They differ for
 * every recording after the first, and two recordings can share a local second, so
 * keying by `time` would both miss and collide.
 *
 * ## Sibling candidates (apps#429)
 *
 * The writer's second is often *nearly* right but lands on a bad instant — mid-blink,
 * a transition. Studio's blog card answers that with a "Change frame" filmstrip of
 * nearby moments (issue #91), captured in the browser on demand. The port's review
 * island cannot capture anything itself (an opaque-origin frame, no pipeline of its
 * own to poll), so the candidates are captured HERE, up front, in the same
 * `video/frames` job: after the tokens' own frames, one still per grid point of
 * Studio's ±`BLOG_SIBLING_WINDOW` around every token. The grid is the finest of
 * `SIBLING_STEPS` that keeps the whole job under `FRAME_BUDGET` — coarser than
 * Studio's 2 s, because every candidate costs an ffmpeg seek whether or not anyone
 * looks at it — and no candidates at all if even the coarsest would not fit. A
 * candidate is keyed by its own global second, so "Use this frame" is just the token
 * retimed and `blog-bundle` needs no change. `siblings: false` (the workflow passes
 * `!run.headless`) switches them off: an unattended run skips the review island, so
 * capturing frames nobody will pick is pure ffmpeg time.
