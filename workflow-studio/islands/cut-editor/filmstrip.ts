/**
 * The filmstrip gutter's input. Studio's `CutEditor` takes `FilmFrame[]` — one entry
 * per contact-sheet cell, each carrying the sheet's sprite geometry so the row at 0:12
 * can crop the 0:12 frame out of the sheet image with `background-position`.
 *
 * In Studio those sheets are composed in the browser, so their geometry is known by
 * construction. Here they arrive as `sheets` (a list of `FileRef`s — this source's leg of
 * the `sheets` matrix job) plus `times` (R118 — one array of capture seconds per sheet,
 * parallel to it) and `cols` (CE's reported grid width per sheet, parallel again). Any of
 * them may be null or empty when that recording's capture was skipped (R147), which just
 * means an empty gutter. Everything else has to be reconstructed from what CE's tiler
 * actually does, plus the image's own pixel size.
 *
 * ## CE's real sheet geometry (R143)
 *
 * `video/contact-sheet` runs CE's ffmpeg `frames` op with `tile: { perSheet: 12,
 * columns: 3 }`, and CE emits
 * `tile=${cols}x${rows}:padding=2:margin=2:color=0x111111`
 * (`buildTileArgs`, `apps/backend/src/pipelines/ffmpeg/ffmpeg-args.ts`). So the sheet
 * is NOT gapless: ffmpeg's `tile` puts a 2 px **margin** around the outside and 2 px of
 * **padding** between adjacent cells —
 *
 *     width  = cols * cellWidth  + (cols - 1) * padding + 2 * margin
 *     cell x = margin + col * (cellWidth + padding)
 *
 * Studio's `cellGeometry`/`spriteStyle` model a single uniform `gap` on every edge:
 * `width = cols * cellWidth + (cols + 1) * gap` and `x = gap + col * (cellWidth + gap)`.
 * Because CE sets **margin === padding === 2**, the two are the same arithmetic — the
 * Studio model is exact here, with `gap = 2`. (If CE ever made them differ, this
 * mapping would no longer be exact and the sheet would need its own geometry rather
 * than Studio's one-gap model; that is the assumption this file rests on.)
 *
 * `cols` is per-sheet, not the `columns` knob: CE's planner lays a short final sheet
 * out at its own narrower width (`cols = min(chunk.length, columns)` in
 * `ffmpeg.handler.ts`'s `planSheets`), and `buildTileArgs` is handed that value. CE
 * reports it back per sheet (`sheets[].cols`, ce#706), and `video/contact-sheet`'s
 * `check` step carries it through as the result's `cols` array — which is what the
 * island reads (apps#470). A result from before that field existed has no `cols`, so
 * the same `min(SHEET_COLS, times.length)` arithmetic stays as the fallback; it agrees
 * with CE for every sheet this workflow asks for, and only a sheet generated with a
 * different geometry tells the two apart.
 *
 * `cellWidth`/`cellHeight` are computed here rather than left at 0 for
 * `cellGeometry` to derive: `CutEditor` also reads `sheet.cellWidth`/`cellHeight`
 * DIRECTLY for its tall-rows height (`CutEditor.tsx`'s `fullRowHeight` — a falsy
 * `cellWidth` collapses every row to the 32 px band). The numbers are exactly what
 * `cellGeometry` would derive; this way both readers get them.
 *
 * The frames' `time` values are the SOURCE's own clock — the same one `scene.start`/
 * `scene.end` and the transcript words are in, which is what `frameForRow` looks them
 * up by.
