/**
 * `scene-sheet-plan` — the `per-scene` job's `plan` step (`.bffless/workflows/studio.workflow.yaml`).
 *
 *   with:    { start, end }    the scene row's window, LOCAL to its source
 *   outputs: { times, labels } capture seconds + the burned-in clock, parallel
 *
 * Studio's refiner never worked from the director's sheets: it got a second, dense pass —
 * the whole 120-frame / 10-sheet budget spent on ONE scene at a 1 s floor
 * (`planSceneContactSheet`, story 03c). The port fed `refine-scene` the recording's share
 * of the ONE global plan instead (apps#524): ≤120 frames spread across EVERY recording at
 * the project-wide spacing — coarser, and burned with the GLOBAL clock while everything
 * downstream of `director` is source-LOCAL. This step is Studio's per-scene planner as its
 * own `script` step (the same move R116 made for the global plan): the arithmetic is not
 * re-derived — `planSceneContactSheet` IS the plan and `clockLabel` IS the burned-in clock.
 *
 * Both halves come out right at once:
 *
 * - **Density** — the budget belongs to this scene alone, so a ≤120 s scene gets a frame
 *   every second; longer scenes cap at 120 frames and the spacing widens.
 * - **The clock is the scene's own timeline.** `planSceneContactSheet` offsets its times
 *   back into source seconds (`+ start`), which is exactly the timeline the refine prompt
 *   declares for every value — the scene window `[start, end]`, the word timings, the cuts.
 *   The global sheets' clocks disagreed with that timeline for every recording after the
 *   first.
 *
 * A zero-length (or empty) window plans no times; the workflow `if:`-skips the capture
 * step (`video/contact-sheet` refuses an empty plan) and `refine` gets `[]`, which its
 * prep tolerates — the refiner works from the scene's audio and word timings alone.
 *
 * `planSceneContactSheet` can never exceed the 10 sheets `refine-scene` signs
 * (`cellsPerSheet` guarantees ≤ MAX_SHEETS) nor CE's 200-times-per-job cap (MAX_FRAMES
 * is 120), so unlike `sheet-plan` there is no per-source ceiling to enforce here.
