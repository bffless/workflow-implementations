/**
 * `final-script` — `stitch` → step `script`.
 *
 *   with:    { scenes, keep, words }
 *   outputs: { script, chapters }
 *
 * What the finished short actually says, and where its chapters fall. The edit is
 * cut-first (ADR-0003): nothing is re-voiced, so the script IS the original speech
 * that survives the cuts, and a chapter starts at the cumulative KEPT length of the
 * scenes before it — not at any source timestamp. `describe.ts` owns both
 * derivations (`videoScript`, `videoChapters`/`formatChapters`); this step's job is
 * to rebuild the `Scene` objects they read from three parallel lists.
 *
 * The three inputs are in `needs.director.outputs.scenes` order:
 * - `scenes` — the director rows (`start`/`end` LOCAL to each row's own source).
 * - `keep`   — what the cut editor kept, in CLIP-relative seconds: the scene's clip
 *              was sliced as `[scene.start, scene.end]`, so clip 0 IS `scene.start`.
 * - `words`  — each scene's `scene_words` from `scene-inputs`, in SOURCE seconds.
 *
 * Studio stored cuts, not keeps, so `keep` is inverted back into cuts before the
 * helpers see it — `keptSpans` already computes exactly that complement (it is the
 * same function run the other way round), which keeps the 0.05s sliver tolerance
 * identical in both directions.
