/**
 * `sheet-plan` — the `plan` job's only step (`.bffless/workflows/studio.workflow.yaml`).
 *
 *   with:    { sources, durations }   the recordings, in `per-video` order
 *   outputs: { plans }                one entry per source, fed to the `sheets` matrix
 *
 * Studio computed this plan in the browser right before it captured the frames itself;
 * the workflow has to hand the timestamps to a pipeline as data, so the plan becomes its
 * own step (R116). The arithmetic is not re-derived here — `planGlobalSheetCaptures` IS
 * the rule and `clockLabel` IS the burned-in clock the director reads a moment off.
 *
 * ## One plan for the whole project, not one per recording (R147)
 *
 * Studio lays every source end to end on ONE global timeline and plans the director's
 * sheet across that (`apps/studio/src/lib/globalSheet.ts`): the ≤120-frame / ≤10-image
 * budget is spent once, at a 1 s density floor, and each global timestamp is routed to
 * the source it should be captured from. This step is that planner, nothing more.
 *
 * Two things follow, and both are why planning per recording was wrong:
 *
 * - **The label is the GLOBAL clock.** `scenes` and `blog` shift every transcript line
 *   onto the combined timeline (R132/R135), so a frame burned with its LOCAL time would
 *   disagree with the words beside it for every recording after the first. `times` stay
 *   LOCAL — that is what ffmpeg seeks in the file.
 * - **The budget is shared.** Per-recording planning gave two ≥600 s recordings ten
 *   sheets each, and the consumers sign only the first ten: the second recording
 *   contributed nothing at all.
 *
 * A source is identified to the planner by its INDEX, not its path: the same file
 * uploaded twice would otherwise collapse into one source and swallow the other's frames.
 *
 * `durations` are the transcripts' last word ends rather than container durations (R126),
 * so a time can never overrun the file; `sampleTimes` additionally keeps every time at
 * `duration - 0.05` or below, so a still is never asked for past the last frame.
