/**
 * `sheet-plan` — the `plan` job's step (`.bffless/workflows/studio.workflow.yaml`):
 * `with: { sources, durations }` in, `{ plans }` out, one entry per recording. It is the
 * one script that exists only because the workflow needs it (R116): Studio computed the
 * contact-sheet plan inline in the browser, the workflow has to hand `times` + `labels`
 * to the `video/contact-sheet` pipeline as data.
 *
 * What the suite is really pinning down is R147 — the plan is GLOBAL. One budget across
 * every recording, LOCAL seconds to seek with, and the GLOBAL clock burned onto the
 * frame so the director's images agree with the globally-shifted transcript it reads
 * beside them.
