 * The `refine-scene` pipeline wants three things Studio derived from its store:
 * the scene's own words as `start end word` lines, the tail of the previous
 * scene's kept speech (so cut decisions at the seam aren't made blind), and the
 * word list itself — which the cut-editor island also renders. All three come
 * from Studio's own helpers; nothing is re-implemented here.
 *
 * `words` is THIS scene's source's full WhisperX list — `needs.per-video.outputs.words[scene.sourceIndex]`
 * — so the window slice happens here rather than in an expression.
