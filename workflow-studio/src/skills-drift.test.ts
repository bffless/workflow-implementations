/**
 * `.bffless/skills/**` is a *copy* of `apps/studio/.bffless/skills/**` — the same three
 * skills Studio points its `thumbnail/draft`, `describe` and `blog` steps at, carried
 * here so this implementation's bundle serves them itself (#430; the rules resolve them
 * from the `workflow-studio` alias, see `scripts/stage.mjs`). This app is a PORT: where a
 * prompt or a skill came from Studio it is Studio's, verbatim (CLAUDE.md), and this is
 * the drift check — it fails the moment Studio's copy changes and this one has not been
 * refreshed, the same way `apps/workflow/src/hello-drift.test.ts` pins the spec examples
 * to `bffless/workflow-hello`.
 *
 * Studio is reached through the `studio` workspace dependency (`node_modules/studio` is
 * the symlink pnpm makes), not a `../studio` path — the dependency is the declared
 * relationship; a sibling directory is not.
