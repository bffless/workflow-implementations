 *
 * No new image generation: we reuse the director contact sheets (already
 * captured, timestamped, and uploaded) as CSS sprite sheets. `buildFilmstrip`
 * flattens every sheet's cells into a single time-sorted index; `frameAt` finds
 * the frame nearest a row's time; `spriteStyle` crops that one cell out of its
 * sheet with `background-position`. All pure — the React gutter is just a renderer.
