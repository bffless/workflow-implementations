/**
 * The master director — the brain of the prep pipeline (story 03).
 *
 * One multimodal AI call (Gemini 3.1 Pro on Replicate) is handed three things:
 *
 *   1. the timestamped transcript (story 02),
 *   2. the director contact sheets — interval-sampled frames with the wall-clock
 *      burned on each (story 03 prep stage), as image input, and
 *   3. optional free-text *direction* the user types ("make it punchy", "keep the
 *      demo at 12:30", …).
 *
 * It returns, as strict JSON, a one-line **synopsis** of the whole talk plus the
 * **scenes** (story 13f contract, ADR-0003): each `{ title, start, end, brief,
 * cuts[] }` — a titled window of the recording, its **cutting brief** (the
 * director's prose instructions to the scene refiner), and the coarse baseline
 * footage spans to drop. Scenes **tile** the recording: windows touch
 * end-to-end, so footage can only be dropped by a cut, never by scene omission.
 * There is no script — the final cut is the original recording minus cuts.
 *
 * This module is the *pure* half — request shaping + response coercion — so it's
 * unit-tested and shared by the MSW mock and the real `/api/scenes` pipeline (the
 * pipeline does the same clamping server-side; this is the client-side mirror).
 * The authoritative prompt/system-instruction live in the BFFless pipeline.

 * and local `start`/`end` within that source.
 *
 * Scenes **tile** the recording (story 13f, ADR-0003): on the global timeline
 * the first scene starts at 0, each next scene starts exactly where the
 * previous ended (gaps the model leaves are snapped shut), and the last ends at
 * the total duration — footage can only be dropped by a cut, never by falling
 * between scene windows. The same rule is re-applied per source after
 * assignment, so every second of every source belongs to exactly one scene.
 *
 * A chapter belongs to exactly ONE video, so each scene is assigned to the single
 * source it **overlaps most**, then clamped to that source's local `[start, end)`
 * window (its cuts re-expressed in local coordinates). We deliberately do NOT
 * split a scene into one fragment per source it touches: the director's spans are
 * rounded (e.g. `0–23`), so they routinely overflow the real fractional source
 * durations by a fraction of a second, and splitting turned every such overflow
 * into a duplicate-titled sliver scene. Dominant-source assignment is robust to
 * that — one director scene maps to exactly one stored scene.
 *
 * A scene with no real overlap (≤ 0.05 s) against any source is dropped.
 * Single-source projects behave identically to the old signature: local time
 * equals global time and every scene gets `sourceId = sources[0].id`.
 *
 * Tolerant of both wire shapes: the 13f `brief` and the legacy `refinePrompt`
 * both land in `scene.brief`; a legacy echoed `transcript` is kept, otherwise
 * the transcript is derived from the source's own words in the scene window.
