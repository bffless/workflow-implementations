/**
 * Contact-sheet planning — the pure half of the "director thumbnails" (prep
 * stage 4). We interval-sample frames across the clip and compose them into
 * timestamped grid images handed to the master director (story 03) as visual
 * context, so it can decide what footage to cut, not just rewrite the words.
 *
 * Constraints `planContactSheet` balances:
 *
 * 1. **Density** — sample as finely as `MIN_INTERVAL_SECONDS` for SHORT clips
 *    (closer than that just yields near-duplicate frames), so a short video gets
 *    plenty of frames rather than being needlessly capped at 30s.
 * 2. **Coverage** — but never sparser than `MAX_INTERVAL_SECONDS`, so long clips
 *    don't skip too much (until the frame budget forces it).
 * 3. **Per-frame detail** — the model reads each image at a bounded resolution,
 *    so a few large cells beat many tiny ones: prefer `PREFERRED_CELLS_PER_SHEET`,
 *    allow up to `MAX_CELLS_PER_SHEET`.
 * 4. **Image count** — at most `MAX_SHEETS` images per director call.
 * 5. **Upload size** — ≤ 7 MB per image (enforced in `frames.ts` at encode time).
 *
 * Net behaviour: short clips sample at ~`MIN_INTERVAL` and use as many frames as
 * that needs; once the clip is long enough to hit `MAX_FRAMES` (10 × 12 = 120)
 * the budget caps it and the spacing widens — staying ≤ 30s up to ~60 min, then
 * relaxing past it. The capture and canvas compositing live in `frames.ts`; this
 * file only decides WHICH timestamps to grab and HOW to tile them (pure + tested).
