/**
 * The per-scene refiner — the second pass (story 03c, reshaped by ADR-0003).
 *
 * The master director (story 03) sees the whole talk and returns a per-scene
 * `refinePrompt` (its cutting brief) + coarse `cuts`. The refiner zooms into ONE
 * scene: it spends the whole image budget on that scene (a much denser contact
 * sheet), listens to the scene's soundtrack, and hands back **precise cuts** —
 * nothing else. There is no script: the final cut is the original recording
 * minus cuts (see `docs/adr/0003-cut-first-editing.md`), so the refiner's whole
 * job is deciding which spans of footage die.
 *
 * Like `director.ts`, this is the *pure* half: request shaping + response
 * coercion, shared by the MSW mock and the real `/api/refine-scene` pipeline (the
 * pipeline clamps server-side too; this mirrors it client-side). The
 * authoritative prompt/system-instruction live in the BFFless pipeline. The 13f
 * request carries the scene's timed words, its dense contact sheets, the
 * director's cutting `brief`, and the **measured dead space** (story 13c) so the
 * model can snap cut edges into true silence, never mid-word; the response is
 * `cuts[]` only. Legacy `segments` from an un-updated pipeline are ignored.
 *
 * **Non-destructive:** `toRefinement` produces a `SceneRefinement` that lives in
 * `scene.refined` — it never touches the director's baseline `cuts`, so the
 * producer can always revert by clearing `refined`.
