 * time is sliced into `segmentSeconds`-wide cells (columns) — tenth-seconds by
 * default, since people speak 2–3 words a second and one-second cells pile them
 * up. A word is dropped into the cell for the slice its `start` falls in, so
 * reading left→right then top→bottom walks the audio forward in time.
 *
 * Pure + deterministic so it's trivial to unit-test; the React component is just
 * a renderer over `buildTranscriptGrid`.
